It honors Apollonius, son of Theon, for his exceptional generosity in rebuilding the association's meeting house and its facilities at his own expense after they were destroyed by a flood. The decree outlines specific honors, such as the right to wear a crown and the placement of a shield-monument, and establishes a heavy fine of 3000 drachmas for anyone attempting to rescind these honors. The text concludes with instructions for the decree to be recorded in the association's books and engraved on a stele.",
