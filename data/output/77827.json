  "rationale": "This inscription is a well-known funerary law from Iulis on the island of Ceos. It is a primary source for understanding Greek concepts of 'miasma' (pollution) and the civic regulation of private mourning. It specifies the number of garments allowed for the deceased, the silence required during the procession, and the specific family members who are considered polluted by the death. The text also outlines the purification of the home using sea water and hyssop, and the subsequent sacrifice to the hearth (Hestia).",
