  "rationale": "This inscription is a royal ordinance from the Hellenistic period, likely issued by one of the Attalid kings of Pergamon. It deals with the complex socio-economic reorganization of land, specifically addressing the distribution of allotments (kleroi) to settlers or mercenaries (misthophoroi). It distinguishes between 'bare' land (psile) and vineyards (ampeloi), and between those who have built houses (stegnopoiemenois) and those who have not. It also regulates the payment of tithes on agricultural produce and confirms the validity of property holdings and tax exemptions. The text concludes with instructions to publish the decree on two stelae, one in the temple of Athena (likely at Pergamon) and another in the sanctuary of Apollo at Gryneion.",
