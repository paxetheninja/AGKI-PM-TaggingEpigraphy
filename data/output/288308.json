  "rationale": "This is a sophisticated funerary monument from the Pergamon region. It commemorates Glycon, a highly skilled physician who compares himself to the legendary Hippocrates, and his wife Pantheia. The text is notable for its philosophical and religious reflections on the immortality of the soul and its ascent to the realm of the blessed while the mortal body remains in the earth. It also highlights the professional pride of the medical community in Roman-era Asia Minor. Note that the junior scholar's identification of 'Kaikos' was a misreading of 'akos' (cure).",
