It provides significant biographical detail, including the grandfather's role as an Agoranomos and the father's social standing through horse-breeding (hippotrophia). Uniquely, the deceased gives specific instructions to his brother Philermon to avoid expensive or traditional mourning rituals like cedar oil (kedria) and professional mourners (threnetriai), preferring a simple burial to avoid the 'stench' associated with typical embalming. The cause of death is identified as a cough or respiratory ailment (bech). The text is well-preserved and follows a coherent metrical structure.",
