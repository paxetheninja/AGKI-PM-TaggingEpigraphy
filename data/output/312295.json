It is highly detailed regarding military logistics, specifying that aid must be provided 'with all strength', and includes specific financial clauses for mercenary pay (three staters per month). It also reflects the complex geopolitical reality of the Black Sea region, where local powers had to coordinate their actions with the Persian King.",
