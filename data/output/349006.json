The villagers complain about the 'diaseismos' (extortion) and abuses committed by military officials, specifically frumentarii and colletiones, who were bypassing the authority of the provincial governor to harass the community. The emperors respond by reaffirming that legal accusations must follow the 'laws of the ancestors' and the jurisdiction of the governor, rather than arbitrary military force.",
