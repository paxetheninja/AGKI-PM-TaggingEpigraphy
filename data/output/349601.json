  "rationale": "This is a mid-3rd century BC honorific decree from Kos. It is a significant document for the history of ancient medicine, as it details the actions of a physician, Xenotimos, during a public health crisis. The text distinguishes between private practice and the 'public physicians' (iatroi damosieuontes) who were salaried by the state. Xenotimos is praised for his selflessness in treating the citizens and his fellow doctors without making distinctions, leading to the award of a gold crown and a public proclamation at the Dionysia festival.",
