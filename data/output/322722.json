  "rationale": "This inscription is a fragmentary honorific decree from Mytilene, likely dating to the late 4th century BC. It records the decision of the council and the people to honor an individual named Trometos, identified as a Magnesian, with a golden crown, the titles of proxenos and benefactor, and the grant of citizenship for himself and his descendants. The decree specifies that the honors should be announced during the Dionysia festival and instructs the generals and treasurers to oversee the implementation of these privileges, including the provision of hospitality (xenia) and ensuring the honoree's needs are met by the city.",
